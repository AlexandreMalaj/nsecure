<h1>hasWarnings</h1>
<p>
    This mean that the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis as emitted one or many warnings ! There is many different
    <b>kind</b> of warning:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>(<b>unsafe-import</b>) Unable to parse/detect a dependency name</li>
    <li>(<b>unsafe-regex</b>) Unsafe regex</li>
    <li>(<b>ast-error</b>) An error as occured in the AST Analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2>unsafe-import</h2>
<br />
<p>
    Example if your package contains a .js file with the following content:
</p>
<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nD07oQa.png">
<br />
<p>
    Then the AST analysis will return <span>fs</span>, <span>path</span> and
    <span>./lib</span> as required dependencies. The code will not be considered
    suspicious !<br />
    But if we take a look at a malicious code example:
</p>

<br />
<p>
    This code require the core package http but the AST analysis is not capable
    to get it (not yet üòÅ). So the code will be flagged as "suspect".
</p>
<h2>unsafe-regex</h2>
<p>
    RegEx are dangerous and could lead to ReDos attack. This warning is emitted when
    the package <a href="https://github.com/davisjam/safe-regex" target="_blank">safe-regex</a> return true.

<h2>ast-error</h2>
<p>
    The AST Analysis has failed (return the stack trace of nsecure).
